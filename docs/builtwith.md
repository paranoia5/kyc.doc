# Built With

## Tech and Packages

The app is built based on [react-native] and [Expo] framework. For data storage, we use [Keychain] to provide a way to encrypt and securely store keyâ€“value pairs locally on the device.The app is using functional components and [react-hooks] (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef , ...etc) & [Context API] for state management, and [typescript] for static type-checking along with the latest ECMAScript features. We used [react-navigation V5] for handling stack navigation, tabs, and top bars. We have also used [native-base] and [paper] for some of our UI components

## State Management and Containers

You probably have heard too much about Redux for state management. [Redux] is cool! However, in our app here, we have sort of recreated redux using [react-hooks] and [Context API] without actually installing redux and react-redux and all the middleware that redux might need. Here is a diagram of how it works, and I'm pretty confident to say that it works somehow in a similar fashion as redux. So no surprises! :
